Regular-expression patterns:
Except for control characters, (+ ? . * ^ $ ( ) [ ] { } | \), all characters match themselves. You 
can escape a control character by preceding it with a backslash.
Following table lists the regular expression syntax that is available in Ruby.
Pattern Description
www.Jntufastupdates.com 29
^ Matches beginning of line.
$ Matches end of line.
.
Matches any single character except newline. Using m option allows it to 
match newline as well.
[...] Matches any single character in brackets.
[^...] Matches any single character not in brackets
re* Matches 0 or more occurrences of preceding expression.
re+ Matches 1 or more occurrence of preceding expression.
re? Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of preceding expression.
re{ n} Matches exactly n number of occurrences of preceding expression.
re{ n,} Matches n or more occurrences of preceding expression.
re{ n, m} Matches at least n and at most m occurrences of preceding expression. 
a| b Matches either a or b.
(re) Groups regular expressions and remembers matched text.
(?imx) Temporarily toggles on i, m, or x options within a regular expression. If in 
parentheses, only that area is affected.
(?-imx) Temporarily toggles off i, m, or x options within a regular expression. If in 
parentheses, only that area is affected.
(?: re) Groups regular expressions without remembering matched text. 
(?imx: re) Temporarily toggles on i, m, or x options within parentheses.
(?-imx: re) Temporarily toggles off i, m, or x options within parentheses. 
(?#...) Comment.
(?= re) Specifies position using a pattern. Doesn't have a range.
(?! re) Specifies position using pattern negation. Doesn't have a range.
(?> re) Matches independent pattern without backtracking.
\w Matches word characters.
\W Matches nonword characters.
\s Matches whitespace. Equivalent to [\t\n\r\f].
\S Matches nonwhitespace.
\d Matches digits. Equivalent to [0-9].
\D Matches nondigits.
\A Matches beginning of string.
\Z Matches end of string. If a newline exists, it matches just before newline.
\z Matches end ofstring.
\G Matches point where last match finished.
\b
Matches word boundaries when outside brackets. Matches backspace 
(0x08) when inside brackets.
\B Matches nonword boundaries.
\n, \t, etc. Matches newlines, carriage returns, tabs, etc.
\1...\9 Matches nth grouped subexpression.
\10 Matches nth grouped subexpression if it matched already. Otherwise 
refers to the octal representation of a character code.

Regular-expression Examples:
Literal characters:
Example Description
/ruby/ Match "ruby".
Â¥
Matches Yen sign. Multibyte characters are supported in Ruby 1.9 and 
Ruby 1.8.
Character classes:
Example Description
/[Rr]uby/ Match "Ruby" or "ruby"
/rub[ye]/ Match "ruby" or "rube"
/[aeiou]/ Match any one lowercase vowel
/[0-9]/ Match any digit; same as /[0123456789]/
/[a-z]/ Match any lowercase ASCII letter
/[A-Z]/ Match any uppercase ASCII letter
/[a-zA-Z0-9]/ Match any of the above
/[^aeiou]/ Match anything other than a lowercase vowel
/[^0-9]/ Match anything other than a digit
Special Character Classes:
Example Description
/./ Match any character except newline
/./m In multiline mode . matches newline, too
/\d/ Match a digit: /[0-9]/
/\D/ Match a nondigit: /[^0-9]/
/\s/ Match a whitespace character: /[ \t\r\n\f]/
/\S/ Match nonwhitespace: /[^ \t\r\n\f]/
/\w/ Match a single word character:/[A-Za-z0-9_]/
/\W/ Match a nonword character: /[^A-Za-z0-9_]/
Repetition Cases:
Example Description
/ruby?/ Match "rub" or "ruby": the y is optional
/ruby*/ Match "rub" plus 0 or more ys
/ruby+/ Match "rub" plus 1 or more ys
/\d{3}/ Match exactly 3 digits
/\d{3,}/ Match 3 or more digits
/\d{3,5}/ Match 3, 4, or 5 digits
Nongreedy repetition:
This matches the smallest number of repetitions:
Example Description
/<.*>/ Greedy repetition: matches "<ruby>perl>"
/<.*?>/ Nongreedy: matches "<ruby>" in "<ruby>perl>"
Grouping with parentheses:
Example Description
www.Jntufastupdates.com 31
/\D\d+/ No group: + repeats \d
/(\D\d)+/ Grouped: + repeats \D\d pair
/([Rr]uby(, )?)+/ Match "Ruby", "Ruby, ruby, ruby", etc.
Backreferences:
This matches a previously matched group again:
Example Description
/([Rr])uby&\1ails/ Match ruby&rails or Ruby&Rails
/(['"])(?:(?!\1).)*\1/ Single or double-quoted string. \1 matches whatever the 1st group 
matched . \2 matches whatever the 2nd group matched, etc.
Alternatives:
Example Description
/ruby|rube/ Match "ruby" or "rube"
/rub(y|le))/ Match "ruby" or "ruble"
/ruby(!+|\?)/ "ruby" followed by one or more ! or one ?
Anchors:
This need to specify match position
Example Description
/^Ruby/ Match "Ruby" at the start of a string or internal line
/Ruby$/ Match "Ruby" at the end of a string orline
/\ARuby/ Match "Ruby" at the start of a string
/Ruby\Z/ Match "Ruby" at the end of a string
/\bRuby\b/ Match "Ruby" at a word boundary
/\brub\B/ \B is nonword boundary: match "rub" in "rube" and "ruby" but not alone
/Ruby(?=!)/ Match "Ruby", if followed by an exclamation point
/Ruby(?!!)/ Match "Ruby", if not followed by an exclamation point
Special syntax with parentheses:
Example Description
/R(?#comment)/ Matches "R". All the rest is a comment
/R(?i)uby/ Case-insensitive while matching "uby"
/R(?i:uby)/ Same as above
/rub(?:y|le))/ Group only without creating \1 backreference
